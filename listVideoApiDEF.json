You\\u2019ll also get 25% off if you want the full membership.\\n\\nOver the years, you find that programming is a field littered with pitfalls.  I've seen so many health problems in my colleagues.  And mental burnout, low productivity, loss of focus, and getting lost in the weeds.  For those lucky enough to have landed a job in programming, they are not out of the woods just yet.  Learn my top 7 habits for being an effective coding machine.  \\n\\nI like the word habit here.  A habit is a fundamental change in behavior and mindset.  I think that's the key -- any short-term \"tip\" or \"trick\" can only yield short-term results.  It is the long-lasting value of good habits that will power you through decades of coding.  How many people do you know who have been coding for a decade and still manage to stay happy and healthy?  Yep, just one (me).\\n\\nLet me know your top habits in the comments below.\\n\\nJoin ex-Google/ex-Facebook engineers for my coding interview training: https://techinterviewpro.com/\\n\\ud83d\\ude80\\ud83c\\udf15 Million Token: https://milliontoken.org/\\n\\ud83d\\udcbb 100+ Videos of programming interview problems explained: https://coderpro.com/\\n\\ud83d\\udcbb Sign up for my FREE daily coding interview practice: http://dailyinterviewpro.com/\\n\\ud83d\\udcf7 Learn how I built a $1,000,000+ business on YouTube: http://youtubebackstage.com/\\n\\ud83d\\udcb5 Get 2 FREE Stocks on WeBull valued up to $1850 (when you deposit $100): https://act.webull.com/k/S4oOH2yGOtHk/main\\n\\n\\ud83d\\uded2 All my computer/camera gear: https://www.amazon.com/shop/techlead\\n\\ud83c\\udf81 Get the TechLead wallet (ultra thin) on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3eGPWbB\\n\\u2328\\ufe0f My favorite mechanical keyboard (80 series): http://iqunix.store/techlead\\n\\n\\ud83c\\udf89 Party up:\\nhttps://instagram.com/techleadhd/\\nhttps://twitter.com/techleadhd/\\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/techleadhd/\\n\\nDisclosure: Some links are affiliate links to products.
